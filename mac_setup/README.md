# Key Mapping Setup

Keyboards mostly have three to five keys at the left side of the space key.
Aligning with the MacBook's tiling functionalities, we define the keys from the right side:
- Cmd (Ctrl for Ubuntu),
- Opt (Alt for Ubuntu),
- Ctrl (Super for Ubuntu).

Plus, we map all the keys at the right side of the space key to `fn (globe)`, which is for henkan.

# Any Other Setups

- Use `cmd+}` or `cmd+{` to go back and forward on Google Chrome.
- Use `ctrl+l` to sleep
